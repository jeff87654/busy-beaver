Busy beaver results, with machine-checked proofs.

## BB8/

`1RB0RA_1LC1LF_1RD0LB_1RA1LE_1RZ0LC_1RG1LD_1LC0RH_1RG1LF`, an 8-state, 2-symbol machine that halts
from the blank tape with exactly

    sigma = 12 * (2 ↑^37 3) + 59

ones (Knuth up-arrows), hence after more than 2 ↑^37 3 steps. It runs the BB(7) champion's program
(Kropitz 2025, analysed by Ligocki) with 36 digits instead of 12.

  the analysis, in the notation of the wiki page of the BB(7) champion (configurations, low/mid/high
  level rules, bound), and a comparison with that champion.

  (`bd2e36f`, Coq 8.20.1): `halt : halts tm c0`, the score lower bounds `2↑^11 2↑^11 3 < N` and
  `2↑^35 2↑^35 3 < N`, and the exact score `N = 12 * (2↑^37 3) + 58` (N counts the ones before the
  final write; score = N + 1). No axioms. See `BB8/verify/README.md` for the compile commands.
- [`BB8/tools/ligocki_notation.py`](BB8/tools/ligocki_notation.py): an independent cell-by-cell
  simulator that extracts the `B(a; b, ..., z)` configurations and rules of both machines.
